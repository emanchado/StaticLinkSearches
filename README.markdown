DEPRECATED
==========

This program is deprecated. It probably doesn't work anymore on more recent versions of Scala anyway.






Old README contents
===================

This is a proof of concept, small sample utility using the
[Scala Opera Link library](https://github.com/emanchado/Scala-OperaLink).

It generates a static HTML page with the search engines you have
stored in your Opera Link account so you can easily access your
favourite searches from a single page. The generated HTML page can be
uploaded to the internet so you can access it even if you don't have
Opera handy or you can't access your Opera Link account.

I know it's not terribly useful, but it's an example of how to use the
Opera Link library from Scala. In the future, I might do something
fancier like having a single search box from which you can search
using the search engine keywords, as if you were using Opera with your
Opera Link account.

To use it, you'll need the following libraries available (e.g. copied
to the lib/ directory):

* Opera Link library - https://github.com/emanchado/Scala-OperaLink
* Scalate - http://scalate.fusesource.org/
